        <p class="intro">Discover the captivating journey of basketball, from its inception to its current global prominence.</p>

        <div class="history-content">
            <p class="title">Origins (1891)</p>
          <p>
            Basketball was invented in December 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a physical education instructor at the International YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. Tasked with creating an indoor game to keep his students active during the cold New England winters, Naismith devised a game that combined skill, physical activity, and minimal physical contact. 
          </p>
          <p>
            He nailed a peach basket to the wall of the gymnasium and used a soccer ball for gameplay. The first game was played on December 21, 1891, with nine players on each team and basic rules that emphasized passing and shooting. The game ended with a score of 1-0, with the lone basket scored by William R. Chase.
          </p>

          <p class="title">Early Development (1892–1930s)</p>
          <p>
            The game quickly gained popularity. By 1892, Naismith wrote the first set of 13 rules, which remain the foundation of modern basketball. The sport spread through YMCA chapters and was soon introduced to schools, colleges, and communities across the United States and internationally.
         </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1893, women began playing basketball, with Smith College hosting the first women’s game.</li>
                <li>In 1896, the first recorded professional basketball game was played in Trenton, New Jersey.</li>
            </ul>
            During this period, significant changes occurred:
            <ul>
                <li>The peach basket was replaced with a hoop and backboard in 1906.</li>
                <li>Dribbling, originally not allowed, became an integral part of the game as basketballs improved in design.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p class="title">Rise of Collegiate Basketball (1930s–1940s)</p>
          <p>The sport gained momentum in colleges, leading to the establishment of the first college basketball league in the 1930s. The National Invitation Tournament (NIT) was first held in 1938, followed by the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament in 1939.
         </p>
          <p>
            The 1940s also saw the creation of the first professional basketball leagues:
            <ul>
                <li>The Basketball Association of America (BAA) in 1946.</li>
                <li>The National Basketball League (NBL) merged with the BAA in 1949 to form the National Basketball Association (NBA).</li>
            
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p class="title">The NBA Era (1950s–1970s)</p>
          <p>The NBA emerged as the premier basketball league, featuring players like George Mikan, the league’s first dominant big man, and Bob Cousy, a pioneering point guard.
            Key developments during this era included:
         </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The introduction of the 24-second shot clock in 1954, revolutionizing the pace of the game.</li>
                <li>The rise of the Boston Celtics, who dominated the league with 11 championships from 1957 to 1969, led by Bill Russell.</li>
                <li>The first televised NBA game in 1953, which brought the sport to a national audience.</li>
            
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p class="title">Global Expansion (1980s–1990s)</p>
          <p>In the 1980s, basketball saw a surge in global popularity, thanks to players like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan, whose dominance with the Chicago Bulls turned him into an international icon.</p>
          <p>The NBA expanded internationally by broadcasting games worldwide. The formation of the “Dream Team” in the 1992 Olympics, featuring Jordan, Bird, and Johnson, further cemented basketball’s global appeal.</p>
          <p>The Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) was founded in 1996, providing a professional platform for women’s basketball in the U.S.</p>
          
          <p class="title">Modern Basketball (2000s–Present)</p>
          <p>Basketball has continued to grow as one of the most popular sports globally. Innovations in technology and analytics have transformed the way teams play and evaluate talent.
         </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
                <li>The NBA expanded its reach with games played internationally, such as in China, Mexico, and Europe.</li>
                <li>The rise of players like Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, and Stephen Curry has inspired new generations of fans.</li>
                <li>Advances in training and sports science have improved player performance and longevity.</li>
            </ul>
            Today, basketball is played at every level worldwide, from street courts to professional leagues. Its inclusiveness and adaptability ensure its place as a beloved global sport.
